# Word2Vec for Text Embedding

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for training and using the Word2Vec model to generate word embeddings for natural language text. Word2Vec is a shallow, two-layer neural network model that learns distributed representations of words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.

## Project Overview
The notebook demonstrates how to use Word2Vec for training word embeddings on a text corpus and how to load pre-trained word vectors for downstream tasks. It leverages the Google Colab environment to mount Google Drive for easy dataset access and installation of necessary libraries.

## Features:
- **Google Drive Integration**: The notebook automatically mounts Google Drive to access the dataset and store results.
- **Word2Vec Training**: Word2Vec is trained on a provided text corpus, converting words into vector representations that capture semantic meanings.
- **Text Preprocessing**: The notebook includes preprocessing steps such as tokenization and cleaning of text data before training.
- **Installation of Dependencies**: The required libraries, including `pyarrow` and others, are installed using pip.

## Requirements:
To run this notebook, you'll need the following libraries:
- `gensim` (for Word2Vec)
- `pyarrow` (for efficient file handling)
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `google.colab` (if using Google Colab)

## Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository or open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Mount your Google Drive to access any datasets stored in your Google Drive.
3. Install the necessary libraries using pip (the notebook takes care of this).
4. Run the cells in the notebook step-by-step to preprocess data, train the Word2Vec model, and generate word embeddings.

## How to Use:
1. Upload your text data or use any text corpus stored in your Google Drive.
2. Run the preprocessing steps and train the Word2Vec model to generate word embeddings.
3. Use the embeddings for downstream tasks like word similarity, analogy solving, or text classification.

## Evaluation:
The quality of word embeddings can be evaluated by performing tasks like:
- **Word similarity**: Measure how similar two words are based on their vector representations.
- **Word analogy**: Solve word analogies (e.g., "king" is to "queen" as "man" is to "woman").
